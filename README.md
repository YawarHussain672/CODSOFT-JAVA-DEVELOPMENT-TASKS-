# Hi there and welcome to my My Projects Repository website.

This repository holds some of the projects I have completed which aims at demonstrating some of the coding ability I possess. The projects included in this repository are:

## 1. Number Game

A simple interactive game that will develop a program that generates a random number and the user will have to guess that number within a given range. The game guides and instructs the user; therefore, it is quite informative and interactive at the same time.

## 2. Student Grade Calculator

A simple yet useful tool for students and teachers alike, built using Java. This calculator takes in grades and weights as input and calculates the overall grade, providing a convenient way to track academic performance

## 3. ATM Interface

A Java-based imitation of the automated banking teller machine through which the users can carry out deposits, withdrawals, and balances check. This project proves my understandings and applying of object-oriented programming and user interface design in Java.

These project also illustrate my capacity in designing and implementing Java language based applications with the use of Java concepts and technologies. I hope you will find them rather interesting and informative.

#### Please feel free to use these projects for learning purposes and knowledge gain. Happy coding!
