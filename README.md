# Hi there and welcome to my My Projects Repository website.

This repository holds some of the projects I have completed which aims at demonstrating some of the coding ability I possess. The projects included in this repository are:

## 1. Number Game

A simple interactive game that will develop a program that generates a random number and the user will have to guess that number within a given range. The game guides and instructs the user; therefore, it is quite informative and interactive at the same time.

## 2. Student Grade Calculator

A simple yet useful tool for students and teachers alike, built using Java. This calculator takes in grades and weights as input and calculates the overall grade, providing a convenient way to track academic performance

## 3. ATM Interface

An application that imitates an ATM and where users are able to make deposits, withdrawals and even check balances. The concept that is illustrated in this project is on object-oriented programming and graphical user interface.

These projects also depict my acumen of coding and testing software applications using different programming languages and platforms. Please enjoy reading them and I assure you they will be both, interesting and informative.

#### Please feel free to use these projects for learning purposes and knowledge gain. Happy coding!
